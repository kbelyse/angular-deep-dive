# Angular Learning Log

Personal notes as I go, mostly so I can look back and explain *why* something
is built the way it is, not just what it does.

## 2026-07-20 — Project setup, boot process, first component

**How the app actually boots:**
1. Browser loads `src/index.html`. Only meaningful line: `<app-root></app-root>`,
   an empty tag with no behavior yet.
2. `src/main.ts` runs: `bootstrapApplication(App, appConfig)`.
3. `appConfig` (in `app.config.ts`) builds the dependency-injection registry —
   router, zone-based change detection, error listeners.
4. Angular instantiates `App` (from `app.ts`) and mounts it into `<app-root>`,
   rendering `app.html`.
5. `app.html` references `<app-counter />`, which Angular resolves via `App`'s
   `imports` array and mounts in turn, rendering `counter.html`.

So the component tree is rooted at `App`, and everything else nests inside it.
`index.html` never changes — it's a static shell. `app.html` is the first
thing Angular itself renders.

**Project structure, what each piece is for:**
- `angular.json` — the build recipe (entry file, style language, asset paths).
- `tsconfig.json` / `tsconfig.app.json` / `tsconfig.spec.json` — TS compiler
  rules; app and test code use separate configs because tests need Vitest's
  global types and a different output dir.
- `src/styles.scss` — global, unscoped styles.
- Each component is a quartet: `.ts` (class), `.html` (template), `.scss`
  (styles scoped to that component only), `.spec.ts` (tests).
- `app.routes.ts` — currently an empty array, so `<router-outlet>` renders
  nothing. Routing is a later topic.

**Signals, not plain fields, for state:**
- `OnPush` change detection is the *default* now (unset = OnPush). Under
  OnPush, a component only re-renders when an `@Input()` changes by
  reference, a signal it reads changes, or an event fires inside it.
- A plain mutated class field can look like it works only because a click
  handler runs inside the same component. State changed from outside (a
  subscription, `setTimeout`, a parent) would silently fail to re-render.
  Signals are the actual thing OnPush watches for.
- `computed()` is memoized — it only re-runs when its dependencies change,
  not on every change-detection pass. Matters once you're deriving something
  expensive (filtering/sorting a large dataset) instead of simple math.
- `update((v) => v + 1)` operates on the current value; `set()` replaces it
  outright. Use `update` when deriving the next state from the last one.

**Testing:** test through the public interface (rendered DOM, clicks), not
by reaching into a component's internal state. `count` and `doubled` on
`Counter` are `protected` on purpose — only the template can read them
directly, tests go through button clicks and rendered text instead.

**Dependency injection is a second, separate graph from the component tree.**
Components nest because of what renders inside what. Providers registered in
`app.config.ts` are a flat registry available to anything via `inject()`,
without manually passing them down through every intermediate component.
This is also how unrelated components (siblings, or anything not in a direct
parent/child line) share state — through a common injected service, since
there's no implicit global mutable state.

**Component communication (not used yet, but the mechanism):**
- Parent → child: `input()` — parent sets `<app-counter [start]="5" />`,
  child declares `start = input(0)`.
- Child → parent: `output()` — child does `this.changed.emit(value)`, parent
  listens with `(changed)="onChanged($event)"`.
- Unrelated components: shared injectable service, not direct reference.

**Why `npm start` instead of `ng serve` directly:** the global `ng` on this
machine is actually an unrelated tool (`ng-common`/ngspice) — a naming
collision, not Angular CLI. `npm start` (and `npx ng`) resolve to this
project's *local* `node_modules/.bin/ng`, matching the exact version pinned
in `package-lock.json`, regardless of what's globally installed. It also
means the same three commands (`npm start`, `npm test`, `npm run build`)
work the same way across any Node project, not just Angular ones.

## 2026-07-21 — Version upgrades & component communication

**Upgrade one major version at a time (17 → 18 → 19 → ... → 22), never skip:**
- `ng update @angular/core@18 @angular/cli@18`, verify, commit, repeat.
- Each version's `ng update` schematics (automated codemods) assume you're
  migrating from the immediately previous version. Skipping a hop means
  losing that automation and inheriting several versions' worth of manual
  cleanup at once.
- Angular keeps deprecated APIs working for at least one major version before
  removal — that window is only useful if you actually stop at each version.
- One hop at a time = a working, tested checkpoint after each step, and if
  something breaks, it's obvious which version caused it.

**Why not rewrite from scratch:** throws away everything `ng update`
automates plus all existing tests and accumulated edge-case fixes, for a
large reinvestment with no functional gain. Only makes sense for small,
low-stakes, or already-obsolete projects — not something with real usage
depending on it.

**Tool:** [update.angular.io](https://update.angular.io) — enter current and
target version, get the exact ordered command sequence.

**Built `input()`/`output()` for real — split `Counter`'s two buttons into a
new `CounterButton` component:**
```ts
// counter-button.ts
export class CounterButton {
  readonly label = input.required<string>();
  readonly pressed = output<void>();

  onClick(): void {
    this.pressed.emit();
  }
}
```
```html
<!-- counter.html -->
<app-counter-button label="-" (pressed)="decrement()" />
<span class="count">{{ count() }}</span>
<app-counter-button label="+" (pressed)="increment()" />
```
- `CounterButton` is dumb on purpose — it doesn't know what "increment" or
  "decrement" means, only that it was clicked. `Counter` stays the only place
  that owns state and decides what a click means. Data flows down (`label`),
  events flow up (`pressed`).
- `input.required<string>()` instead of a default value: there's no sane
  default for a button's label, so making it required means the compiler
  rejects `<app-counter-button />` used without one, instead of silently
  shipping an empty button.
- `output<void>()`, no payload: the child isn't sending data, just signaling
  "I was pressed" — the parent already knows what that means based on which
  instance fired. Contrast with an output that *would* carry data, like a
  search box emitting the typed string.
- Testing an `output()` directly: `component.pressed.subscribe(spy)`, then
  click and assert the spy fired — same idea as subscribing to any event
  emitter, no template needed for a unit test.
- Testing a `.required` input: must call `fixture.componentRef.setInput(...)`
  *before* the first `detectChanges()`, or Angular throws (`NG0950`) because
  the required input was never supplied.
- Confirmed by running the existing `Counter` tests unchanged after the
  refactor: they still find `<button>` elements via
  `fixture.nativeElement.querySelectorAll('button')`, which proves a child
  component's rendered DOM really does nest inside the parent's tree in the
  test fixture — `ViewEncapsulation.Emulated` (the default) only scopes CSS,
  it doesn't hide or isolate the DOM structure itself.

**Accessibility pass on `CounterButton` — required by the CLAUDE.md rules
(WCAG AA, AXE-clean), and a real gap, not a theoretical one:**
- `-` and `+` alone give a screen reader nothing to say beyond "minus" /
  "plus" — no context for what they control. Added a second required input,
  `ariaLabel`, kept separate from the visual `label` on purpose: there's no
  way to derive "Decrease count" from `"-"` programmatically without baking
  assumptions into a component meant to be reusable for any pair of actions.
- Bound it with `[attr.aria-label]`, not a plain property binding — ARIA
  attributes are HTML attributes, not reliably reflected DOM properties, so
  `attr.` binding is the correct Angular idiom for anything in `aria-*`.
- Added `aria-live="polite"` to the `.count` span in `counter.html`. Without
  it, nothing announces that the count changed unless focus happens to be on
  that exact element — a keyboard/screen-reader user pressing the button
  gets no feedback that anything happened.
- `:focus-visible` on the button in `counter-button.scss` isn't decorative —
  it's WCAG 2.4.7 (visible focus indicator). CSS resets often strip the
  browser's default outline, so it needs to be declared explicitly.

**Styling, and what view encapsulation actually guarantees:**
- `counter.scss` / `counter-button.scss` were empty until now — every
  component gets its own scoped stylesheet, and a plain `button { ... }`
  selector in `counter-button.scss` can only ever match buttons rendered
  inside `CounterButton`'s own template. It can't leak out to restyle
  unrelated buttons elsewhere, and no page-wide style can reach in here
  either — that's what `ViewEncapsulation.Emulated` (the default) buys you.
- `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums` on `.count` stops the layout jittering
  as the digit count changes — `9` and `10` render at different natural
  widths in most fonts otherwise.

**Added a Reset control — first real use of `set()` instead of `update()`:**
```ts
reset(): void {
  this.count.set(0);
}
```
This is the case `set()` is actually for: resetting to zero doesn't depend
on the current value at all, so there's nothing to derive — `update(() => 0)`
would work but is needless indirection when you already know the new value
outright.

**Bug this exposed:** `CounterButton`'s button had a fixed `width: 2.5rem`,
sized for single characters like `-`/`+`. Adding a "Reset" label overflowed
it. Fixed by switching to `min-width` + horizontal padding — a small but
real lesson in not hardcoding assumptions from the first use case into a
component meant to be reused for others.
